# YouTube Focus Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you avoid distractions on YouTube.  
It can blur the homepage feed so you donâ€™t get caught in endless scrolling and can disable Shorts by redirecting them back to the homepage.  
You can turn each feature on or off from the extensionâ€™s popup.  
No tracking, no ads â€” works entirely in your browser.
